                <h3>The Economics</h3><br/>
                <h5>Government and Policy</h5>
                <p>Stable policies play the key role of attracting investments. Unstable policies
                    with frequent changes are undesired.<br/>
                </p><br/>
                <h5>Green Banks</h5>
                <p>Entities that will act as intermediaries in handling financing. They bring expertise and specialise
                    in the sector,
                    providing confidence to investors.<br/>
                </p><br/>
                <h5>Private Investments</h5>
                <p>Most of the funding in renewable energy comes from the private sector. Individuals and companies
                    are increasingly incorporating environmentally friendly features in their missions (i.e. Google's <a
                        href="https://sustainability.google/projects/announcement-100/"
                        target="_blank">commitment</a> to running their operations on 100% renewable energy).<br/>
                </p><br/>
                <h5><a>Crowdfunding Platforms</a></h5>
                <p>Crowdfunding has two main advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li type="i">Supporting renewable energy project developers with access to financing</li>
                    <li type="i">Making investments accessible to the part of the public who wish to support
                        projects
                        with small investments
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Strong support for the renewable energy crowdfunding is shown by the <a
